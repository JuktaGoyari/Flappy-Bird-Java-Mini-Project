# Flappy-Bird-Java-Mini-Project
#Aim: Flappy Bird Game
#Objective:
1. To make a very simple Java-based gaming app in which the main character (which is
the bird) has to reach the final destination after crossing all the hurdles.
2. In this gaming application, the player has to control the movement of the bird.
3. The flappy bird only ascends when there's a tap by the player and descends the rest
of the time.
4. There shouldn't be any collision with any hurdle, or else the game will end and the
player will have to restart the game.
